IMPORTANT!!!!!
There are several issues with the grouping and preferences in the input data:

- (!!) 1111 is in 3 different preference forms: (listed in the same order as input)
	1069,1111,2,3,1
	1111,1010,1,8,3
	1010,1111,1,8,3
1069 and 1010 did not appear in any other forms.
I have manually changed the first line to "1069,9999,2,3,1", so that 1010 and 1111 are paired, while 1069 is treated as a single person. If 1111 wants to pair with 1069 instead, the algorithm needs to be rerun.

- (!!) 1148 is in 3 different preference forms:
	1148,1107,3,1,2
	1107,1148,3,1,2
	1094,1148,8,4,3
1107 and 1148 did not appear in any other forms.
Due to the way the algorithm is coded, 1148 is paired with 1107, while 1094 is treated as a single person with preferences 8,4,3. If 1148 wants to pair with 1094 instead, the algorithm needs to be rerun.

- 1092 first submitted the form by themselves and then as 1133,1092.
- 1009 first submitted the form by themselves and then as 1014,1009.
- 1110 and 1034 each submitted the form individually, and then as a group 1110,1034.

- The following groups submitted twice with different preferences:

	Warning: Pair 1108, 1043 has contradicting preferences submitted.
	Preference submitted by pair 1108, 1043: 3, 2, 4
	Preference submitted by pair 1043, 1108: 3, 4, 2
	Program currently uses preference 3, 2, 4.

	Warning: Pair 1062, 1125 has contradicting preferences submitted.
	Preference submitted by pair 1062, 1125: 4, 1, 3
	Preference submitted by pair 1125, 1062: 1, 3, 4
	Program currently uses preference 4, 1, 3.

	Warning: Pair 1074, 1057 has contradicting preferences submitted.
	Preference submitted by pair 1074, 1057: 1, 4, 3
	Preference submitted by pair 1057, 1074: 1, 4, 7
	Program currently uses preference 1, 4, 3.

	Warning: Pair 1104, 1146 has contradicting preferences submitted.
	Preference submitted by pair 1104, 1146: 4, 3, 1
	Preference submitted by pair 1146, 1104: 4, 7, 3
	Program currently uses preference 4, 3, 1.

	Warning: Pair 1033, 1126 has contradicting preferences submitted.
	Preference submitted by pair 1033, 1126: 1, 4, 3
	Preference submitted by pair 1126, 1033: 4, 1, 3
	Program currently uses preference 1, 4, 3.

-----------------------------------------------------

Process used:
After making the manual change with 1069 (described above), I ran my program with a few changes:
	- PREF_VALUES is now set to [8, 6, 3], so that it values second choice more than before (used to be [8, 4, 2]).
	- Some parts of the code have been optimized since 5-person groups are no longer needed, significantly improving efficiency.
	- There are now 3 independent runs of the DP instead of 2.

I manually checked all groups in the output, and it appears that with the exception of 1 person, everyone who indicated preferences got their first choice. Many people did not submit the preference form and were hence assigned to random topics when needed.
Two of the 3-person groups might be noteworthy:
- "1140,1098,1045,7": 1140 indicated 7,0,0, 1098 and 1045 didn't give any topic
- "1094,1020,1128,8": 1094 (involved in data issue above) indicated 8,4,3, 1020 and 1128 didn't give any topic
I'm not sure how stable this kind of groups will be, given that for both of them, two members didn't even fill out the preference form, and topics 7 and 8 seem to be among the least popular ones. However, the size of the class means there will need to be either 3 groups of 3 or one group of 5.
